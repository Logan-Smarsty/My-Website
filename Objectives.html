   <div id="visiontext">
    <p>When looking to take baron or rift herald you can't just do it right away. Before taking any objective you and your team need to set up properly for the objective. Setting up consists of getting vision around the baron pit. The image shows different color dots, these colored dots are representing the places that need to be warded before taking baron for each team. So blue team would place control wards and regular trinket wards on those blue spots by the baron pit before taking baron. And red team does the same thing for their red spots. After the wards are placed down from the team you still aren't ready to take baron. Before starting to kill baron you need to also sweep the pit and other spots around it and clear out any vision the enemies have. This is going to cancel out any vision and knowledge the enemies have on your baron and will make it harder for the enemy jungler to steal the baron or rift herald and stop the enemies from contesting. Before starting to take vision around the baron pit your team needs to reset to base and refill on control wards and trinkets.</p>
    </div>


    <div id="taketext">
        <p>Before taking baron or rift herald make sure you are taking vision control first. Once that is done the second thing you need to make sure of is getting your waves in each lane pushing or at neutral state. You don't want to go to take baron or rift herald with the enemy waves pushing your towers because then they can just push your base while you're killing baron or rift herald. Another thing you need to do is keep track of numbers advantage and numbers disadvantage. You never want to go for baron or rift herald when you are down in numbres unless you are significantally stronger than the enemy team. A good thing to do is have someone on your team with teleport push bot lane and you other four players pressuring the baron or rift herald because the enemy team will have to send somebody to answer your teammate that is splitting in bot lane and then your splitter can teleport. Doing that will give your team the numbers advantage and make your baron take so much easier and safer. Once your team successfully takes baron you want to reset back to base and start a push. If your team takes rift herald you want to find a lane to push and use rift herald and take towers with it.</p>

        <h2>Taking Dragon</h2>    
    </div>

    <div id="dragtext">
        <p>When looking to take dragon you have to get vision around it before you actually do it. This does not apply if the enemies are dead because then it's just a free dragon. The image shows the red dots for spots to ward for the red team and the blue dots are spots to ward for the blue team. The yellow dots are spots that either team should be placing control wards because it gets rid of the other teams vision in that spot and gives your team vision. To take the dragon it is always smart to place a control ward inside of the dragon pit right when you start it because that voids all of their vision inside of the pit and they won't see how much damage you have done to the dragon. Before taking the dragon it is smart to ask you bot laners to come help clear any vision in the bot jungles so the enemies are blind to the dragon.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="dragtext2">
        <p>Before taking any dragons you and your team need to make sure you get vision control first because doing it while the enemy has full vision control will almost always result in them stealing dragon or killing your team. You also need to make sure that your mid and bot laners have priority over their enemy laners. Onec you decide you want to go for dragon have your mid and bot lanes shove the waves under the enemy towers because that forces the enemies to stay in lane and catch the waves or come to dragon and miss out on the minion gold and experience. You also need to remember that losing out on dragons is not the end of the world as long as you aren't already down a few dragons. Giving up the first two dragons isn't as bad as most players think it is because some team comps need to scale to mid or late game before doing anything.</p>

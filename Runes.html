    <div id="precbox">
        <p>The Precision path provides runes that empower your attacks and increase your damage output, allowing for more aggressive plays. Many Precision runes also help you deal sustained damage and stay alive in extended fights.

            Keystone Runes
            
            Press the Attack:“Hitting an enemy champion with 3 consecutive basic attacks deals 40 – 180 bonus adaptive damage (based on level), and makes them vulnerable, increasing the damage they take by 8 – 12% from all sources for 6s.
            
            Lethal Tempo:“Gain 15% (Melee) or 5% (Ranged) attack speed for 6 seconds when you attack an enemy champion. This effect stacks up to 90% (Melee) or 30% (Ranged).”
            
            Fleet Footwork:“Attacking and moving builds energy stacks. At 100 stacks, your next attack is energized. Energized attacks heal you for 10 – 100 (+0.4 bonus AD, +0.3 AP) and grant 20% move speed for 1s.”
            
            Conqueror:“Basic attacks or spells that deal damage to an enemy champion grant 2 stacks of conqueror for 4 seconds, gaining 2 – 4 adaptive force per stack. When fully stacked, heal for 9% of the damage you deal to champions (6% for ranged champions).</p>
    </div>

    <div id="Domination">
        <h2>Domination</h2>
    </div>

    <div id="Dom">
        <img height="300" width="600" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/ccckgjf9/production/b85eb2c490c70886f4ecd6589d4d9e43472ccb1b-670x344.png?max-h=1080&max-w=1920&fit=scale&auto=format"/>
    </div>

    <div id="dombox">
        <p>While Precision prioritizes sustained damage output, runes in the Domination path are all about upping your burst potential; they increase sudden damage output during short trades, and help you shred through squishy opponents. There are also Domination runes that improve your opportunity to locate and isolate enemy targets.

            Keystone Runes
            
            Electrocute:“Hitting a champion with 3 separate attacks or abilities within 3 seconds deals bonus adaptive damage.”
            
            Hail of Blades:“Gain 110% attack speed when you attack an enemy champion for up to 3 attacks.”
            
            Predator:“Enhance your boots with the active effect ‘predator.’ Gain increased move speed, ramping up to 60% move speed over 1 second, while chasing enemy champions. After ramping up, damaging attacks or abilities to champions end this effect, dealing 40 – 120 (+0.2 bonus AD)(+0.1 AP) bonus adaptive damage.”
            
            Dark Harvest:“Damaging a champion below 50% health deals adaptive damage and harvests their soul, permanently increasing dark harvest’s damage by 5.”</p>
    </div>

    <div id="Sorcery">
        <h2>Sorcery</h2>
    </div>

    <div id="Sorc">
        <img height="300" width="600" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/ccckgjf9/production/982786e6621188d1dc88cb250149754b3759c102-670x342.png?max-h=1080&max-w=1920&fit=scale&auto=format"/>
    </div>

    <div id="SorcText">
        <p>Sorcery is the most magical rune path out there. No, seriously. It’s centered around empowering and enhancing AP abilities (aka turning you from Gandalf the Gray to Gandalf the White). Several runes also increase your opportunity to dish out AP damage, whether by giving you more mana or reducing your abilities’ cooldowns.

            Keystone Runes
            
            Summon Aery:“Damaging enemy champions with basic attacks or abilities sends Aery to them, dealing 10 – 40 based on level (+0.1AP) (+0.15 bonus AD). Empowering or protecting allies with abilities sends Aery to them, shielding them for 35 – 80 based on level (+0.25 AP)(+0.4 bonus AD).”
            
            Arcane Comet:“Damaging a champion with an ability hurls a comet at their location, or, if arcane comet is on cooldown, reduces its remaining cooldown.”
            
            Phase Rush:“Hitting an enemy champion with 3 attacks or separate abilities within 4 seconds grants 15 – 40% move speed based on level and 75% slow resistance.”</p>
    </div>

    <div id="Resolvetitle">
        <h2>Resolve</h2>
    </div>

    <div id="Resolve">
        <img height="300" width="600" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/ccckgjf9/production/000960361788dd844104b3ab35cd56366006045d-669x336.png?max-h=1080&max-w=1920&fit=scale&auto=format"/>
    </div>

    <div id="Restext">
        <p>Resolve runes give your champion more sustain and survivability, whether through shielding, resistances or additional health. Some Resolve runes also give your champion extra crowd control, granting you more ways to safely disengage (or catch out your enemies).

            Keystone Runes
            
            Grasp of the Undying:“Every 4 seconds in combat, your next basic attack on a champion will: deal bonus magic damage equal to 4% of your max health, heals you for 2% of your max health, permanently increase your health by 5.”
            
            Aftershock:“After immobilizing an enemy champion, increase your armor and magic resist by 35 + 80% of your bonus resists for 2.5 seconds. Then explode, dealing magic damage to nearby enemies.”
            
            Guardian:“Guard allies within 350 units of you, and allies you target with spells for 2.5 seconds. While guarding, if you or the ally take more than a small amount of damage over the duration of the guard, both of you gain a shield for 1.5 seconds.”</p>
    </div>

    <div id="Inspotitle">
        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    </div>

    <div id="Inspo">
        <img height="300" width="600" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ETjCKuWND8k/maxresdefault.jpg"/>
    </div>

    <div id="Inspotext">
        <p>Out of all the rune lines, Inspiration is the most unique. It gives players new ways to play around their enemy, and many runes provide additional items (or “tools”) that give you an advantage in laning phase.

            Keystone Runes
            
            Glacial Augment:“Immobilizing an enemy champion will cause 3 glacial rays to emanate from them towards you and other nearby enemy champions, creating frozen zones for 3 (+ 100% of the immobilizing effect’s duration) seconds that slow enemies for 35% (+ 5% per 10% heal and shield power) (+2% per 100 bonus attack damage) and reduce their damage by 15% against your allies (not including yourself).”
            
            Unsealed Spellbook:“Swap one of your equipped summoner spells to a new, single use summoner spell. Each unique summoner spell you swap to permanently decreases your swap cooldown by 25 seconds.”
            
            First Strike:“Attacks or abilities against an enemy champion within 0.25 seconds of entering champion combat grants 5 gold and First Strike for 3 seconds, causing you to deal 10% extra damage against champions, and granting 100% (70% for ranged champions) of bonus damage dealt as gold.”</p>
